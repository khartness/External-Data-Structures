This is a test of github, creating a repository of examples for my Information Systems class. This class has evolved into primarily an external data structures course, largely focused on the creation of indexed files. Hash tables, B+ trees, and inverted lists are all discussed.

The examples are not guaranteed to function or even compile and should only be used to inspire your own creations. The examples include an attempt to create a Java DirectIO class that references a file as a collection of objects and some C and COBOL examples. The class is required for our information systems track which includes COBOL programming. I have attempted to pull away a little from language specific teaching to include our C students, as well. All of our students take Java for their first two programming courses, hence the Java example.
edu.shsu.hartness.records is a package for Java classes related to direct record I/O.
I've included some other files but don't have time to review their precise purpose at the moment; I'll try to include a more detailed index in a later version.
