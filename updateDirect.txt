Actions:
    open filename
        mainFilename = filename
        open mainFilename as directFile for input/output
        if directFile does not exist
            open mainFilename as directFile for output
            initialize header with 0 records
            write header
            close directFile
            open mainFilename as directFile for input/output

            read header.
        lastPos = 0

    translatePosition(recordNumber)
        skip header: in languages starting with record 1, add 1
                     (If translating C or Java algorithms that use offsets
                      starting with zero, add 1 for zero-offset languages and
                      2 for languages starting with record 1)
        In languages that treat files as collections of bytes (C, Java), you
        must also multiply the record position by the size of a record in bytes.
    
    translateRecordNumber(position)
        COBOL: subtract 1 from position (2 if using algorithms written with
                                         zero as the first record)
        C: divide position by size of record (then subtract 1 if using
                                    algorithm with zero as the first record)
